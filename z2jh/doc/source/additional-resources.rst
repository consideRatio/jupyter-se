Additional resources
====================

This page contains links and references to other material in the JupyterHub
ecosystem. It may include other guides, examples of JupyterHub deployments,
or posts from the community. If you have a suggestion for something to add
to this page, please
`open an issue <https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues>`_.

* The `JupyterHub Documentation <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
  provides information about JupyterHub itself (not the Kubernetes deployment).
* `Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ allows users to create sharable computational
  environments on-the-fly. It makes heavy use of JupyterHub.
* The `2016 JupyterHub Workshop <https://github.com/jupyter-resources/jupyterhub-2016-workshop>`_
  was an informal gathering to share experience in deploying JupyterHub for various
  use-cases, including teaching and high-performance computing.
