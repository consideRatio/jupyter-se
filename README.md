# About this project
In Sweden, all math teachers are currently trying to learn about programming since they are soon required to help their students utilize programming in maths - it was decided nationally. So teachers they need to be empowered to teach students utilize programming.

I figure we should tackle this challenge by deploying jupyterhubs, they could be used to _teach the teachers_ about programming, and then allow the teachers to _teach the students_ utilize it in maths.

# Project goal
To complement the zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s project by extending it with out of the box functional NbGrader setup suitable for both students and teachers.

# About me
I'm a math and physics teacher for upper secondary school kids in Sweden, working 75% as a teacher and currently spending almost all my free time working on this.
